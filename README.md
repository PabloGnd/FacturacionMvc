Frontend Billing Program
The program utilizes the ApiRest method consisting of three parts. The first part is the database hosted on Azure, the second part includes the APIs responsible for the business logic, and the third part is the view, following a Model-View-Controller (MVC) model. Only the frontend part, which is the view, has been uploaded to GitHub, while the database and APIs are hosted on Azure.

It is an electronic billing program that allows the user to first register as the invoice issuer. Once registered, they can log into the system using the username and password saved during registration.
Within the system, there are various modules, starting with the clients module, where new clients can be added, edited, deleted, and searched by ID number, name, or last name. The products module allows the addition of new products, editing, deletion, and searching for products by description. The users module enables the issuer to manage user permissions for system operation, including adding, editing, and deleting users. The establishments module permits the addition of new establishments or branches, as well as their editing and deletion. The billing module facilitates the creation of invoices to be sent to the tax authorities for approval. The invoice query module provides a list of all approved and unapproved invoices, with an option to resend unapproved invoices to the tax authorities.
